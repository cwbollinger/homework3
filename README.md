### Running Code
* To manually control the robot while detecting markers run `roslauch hw3 manual_explore.launch`.
* To automatically explore the map while detecting markers run `roslauch hw3 auto_explore.launch`.

### Team Contributions
##### Mike
* Integrated OpenCV Hough Transform of LaserScan message
* Tuned Hough Transform parameters
* Derived transform math from robot to map coordinate frame
* Reminded Chris to turn on Rviz marker *every* test run.

##### Chris
* Integrated OpenCV Hough Transform of LaserScan message
* Built the exploration behavior for automated marker detection

### Other Contributions
* Thanks to Jesse Rond for help with Marker code in .world file. 
* Mike's Thinkpad, for dying on us and forcing us to pair program
